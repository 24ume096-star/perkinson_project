# 🎙️ Parkinson’s Voice Detection

A **real-time web application** to screen for Parkinson’s disease using short voice recordings.  
This tool extracts classical voice biomarkers from audio and predicts the probability of Parkinson’s-related voice patterns.

> ⚠ **Disclaimer:** This is for **educational/screening purposes only**. Not a medical diagnosis.

## **Project Files**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | Streamlit web app for recording and predicting Parkinson’s risk |
| `model.py` | Trains a Random Forest pipeline on UCI Parkinson’s dataset and saves it as `.pkl` |
| `accuracy.py` | Evaluates the trained model on a hidden test set and reports accuracy |
| `parkinsons_model_22.pkl` | Trained model + scaler (generated by `model.py`) |
| `parkinsons_unseen_test.csv` | Hidden test set for evaluation |
